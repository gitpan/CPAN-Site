	* mkpackages: applied patch from Matisse Enzer so that it uses
	CPAN::Checksums to generate the CHECKSUMS files.  This probably
	renders it useless for ancient per installations.  Even my debian
	Perl 5.8 requires me to fetch these:

	      Compress-Bzip2-2.09
	      Compress-Zlib-1.41
	      Data-Compare-0.13
	      Text-Glob-0.06
	      Number-Compare-0.01
	      File-Find-Rule-0.28
	      Digest-SHA-5.34
	      CPAN-Checksums-1.039
       
	So fall back to the last version if that is too much hassle for
	you.  I may think about a fall back mode if CPAN::Checksums is not
	available.

	* Integrated patch from Matisse Enzer to generate .readme files.
	* Switching from MD5 to Digest::MD5
	* Gzip now called with the local file name $_.  $File::Find::name
	should not have worked?
