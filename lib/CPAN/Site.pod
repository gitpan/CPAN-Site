=head1 NAME

CPAN::Site - CPAN.pm subclass for adding site local modules

=head1 INHERITANCE

 CPAN::Site
   is a CPAN

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  perl -MCPAN::Site -e shell
  cpansite shell                # alternative

  perl -MCPAN::Site -e 'install AnyModule'
  cpansite install AnyModule    # alternative

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds access to site specific modules to the CPAN.pm install
interface. The general idea is to have a local (pseudo) CPAN server which
is asked first. If the request fails -which is the usual case-, CPAN.pm
switches to the next URL in the list pointing to a real CPAN server.

=head1 DETAILS

=head2 QUICK SETUP EXAMPLE FOR IMPATIENT

This explanation was contributed by Alex Efros.  There is also an
explanation in the manual page of the cpansite script.

Let's say your (registered or un-registered) Pause-ID is IMPATIENT, :)
and you have private module in file Private-Module-1.23.tar.gz. You wish
to make it available from your own CPAN mirror (actually it's better to
call it "overlay" instead) on website http://impatient.net/ located in
directory /var/www/impatient.net/.

=head3 Configuring the server

 # cpan CPAN::Site
 # mkdir -p /var/www/impatient.net/CPAN/authors/id/I/IM/IMPATIENT/
 # cp Private-Module-1.23.tar.gz \
        /var/www/impatient.net/CPAN/authors/id/I/IM/IMPATIENT/
 # cpansite -vl index /var/www/impatient.net/CPAN/

This nested C</I/IM/IMPATIENT/> structure is CPAN's way of avoiding
huge directories.  Your mirror only requires one level.

You may also wish to add C<cpansite index> to cron and have it run every
hour or so.  This way you can just copy new modules to
F</var/www/impatient.net/CPAN/authors/id/I/IM/IMPATIENT/>
and they become automatically available on your CPAN mirror after a while.
To do this you should run C<crontab -e> and add single line like this:

 0 * * * *   cpansite -l index /var/www/impatient.net/CPAN/ &>/dev/null

=head3 Configuring the clients

 # cpan CPAN::Site
 # cpansite
 cpan> o conf urllist unshift http://impatient.net/CPAN/
 cpan> o conf commit

Now clients should C<cpansite> command instead of C<cpan> to
search, install or update modules. The C<cpan> command will use the
real CPAN's indexes.
