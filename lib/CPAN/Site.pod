=head1 NAME

CPAN::Site - CPAN.pm subclass for adding site local modules

=head1 INHERITANCE

 CPAN::Site
   is a CPAN

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  perl -MCPAN::Site -e shell
  cpansite shell                # alternative

  perl -MCPAN::Site -e 'install AnyModule'
  cpansite install AnyModule    # alternative

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds access to site specific modules to the CPAN.pm install
interface. The general idea is to have a local (pseudo) CPAN server which
is asked first. If the request fails -which is the usual case-, CPAN.pm
switches to the next URL in the list pointing to a real CPAN server.

=head1 SEE ALSO

This module is part of CPAN-Site distribution version 0.19,
